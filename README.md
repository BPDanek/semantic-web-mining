Tasks:
- Basics: 
    - get started with chrome tutorial, have working app to build off of
    - app should be able to exit developer mode/distributable  
- Acquire data:
    - read user search queries
    - store in internal data struct (maybe a json which has search query + first 15 result)
    - track which search results were clicked on
- Ratings:
    - provide option for like/dislike one of the search results (beside the hyperlink which google displays?)
- Credentials:
    - user login page+interface
    - user login backend w/ access to data
- Database:
    - acquired data to DB

# Knowledge Graph Usage
Download the [NELL corpus](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/resources), select the download that says "Tab-separated-value file with every belief in the KB, one per line (file format documentation)". Unzip the `.gz` file and rename the `.csv` inside to `knowledgegraphdata.csv`, move it to your working directory.

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The app loads data from `.pkl` files to speed up various processes. The first step is to generate these files. Execute the driver class:

```bash
python driver.py
```

Be forewarned, this will take some time! The NELL corpus is very, very large, which is why this step exists in the first place. 

Set the environment variables `FLASK_APP` and `FLASK_ENV`: 

```bash
export FLASK_APP=endpoint
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

or, if on Windows:

```bash
set FLASK_APP=endpoint
set FLASK_ENV=development
```

Spin up the Flask App

```bash
flask run
```

Request bodies for this need to be computed within Python with spaCy, so run:

```bash
python requestlauncher.py [url_list]
```

where the parameter is a comma-separated list of URLs.

The app will print out (in the console) a similarity matrix where entry (i,j) is the number of common domain terms between URL i and URL j.
